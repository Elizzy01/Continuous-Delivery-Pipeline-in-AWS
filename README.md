# Continuous-Delivery-Pipeline-in-AW
I am about to walk you through how to develop a pipeline to aid smooth logging of changes to this application, which will require manual approval for the changes. We will create the pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, a service that builds, tests, and deploys your code every time there is a code change.

The following diagram visually represents the services used in this project and how they are connected. This application uses GitHub, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline.
